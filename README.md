Hi, I'm Zubair, an aspiring QA Engineer focused on manual testing in real-world platforms.
My mission is to detect bugs, usability issues, integration flaws, and security-related problems through hands-on testing.

# **What‚Äôs in this Portfolio?**

This repository showcases my manual QA work on real applications using mobile and desktop environments.
It includes structured bug reports, test case documentation, and supporting screenshots or video proof.

## **Tools & Processes**

## Tools:

### **JIRA:**
 A widely-used project management and issue tracking tool that helps in logging, tracking, and managing defects throughout the software development lifecycle

### **Postman:**
 A user-friendly tool for testing REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs, allowing testers to simulate API endpoints and verify responses without the need for backend setup.

### **TestRail:**
A comprehensive test management tool designed for organizing test cases, executing tests, and tracking results, ensuring efficient test planning and execution.

## Processes:

### **Requirement Analysis:**
Thoroughly review software requirements specifications (SRS) to understand the intended functionality and identify areas to test.

### **Test Plan Creation**:
Develop a comprehensive test plan that defines the overall testing strategy, including objectives, scope, resources, and timelines

### **Test Execution:**
Execute the test cases in a controlled environment, comparing actual results with expected outcomes and documenting any deviations.

### **Defect Logging:**
Identify and log defects in a bug tracking system, providing clear descriptions, steps to reproduce, and severity levels to facilitate resolution

### **Defect Fix and Re-verification**
Once defects are fixed, re-execute the affected test cases to verify that the issues have been resolved and perform regression testing to ensure no new defects have been introduced.

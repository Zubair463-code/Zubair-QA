Hi, I'm Zubair,an aspiring QA Engineer focused on manual testing in real-world platforms.
My mission is to detect bugs, usability issues, integration flaws, and security-related problems through hands-on testing.
This repository showcases my manual QA work on real applications using mobile and desktop environments.
It includes structured bug reports, test case documentation, and supporting screenshots or video proof.
